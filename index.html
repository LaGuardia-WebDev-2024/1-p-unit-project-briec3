            <p> Frank Ocean's music speaks to me like <strong><em>no other.</em></strong>
                To me, his music is beautful, soothing and intentful, I can relate to a lot of his lyrics like <strong><em> "Super Rich Kids" lol.."My eyes don't shed tears but boy they pour, when I'm thinkin bout you-" and "Ima try to swim from something bigger than me"</em></strong> 
            He will forever be my favorite artist because it feels as if <strong><em>he wrote the song for me specifically,</em></strong> I'm into his lore like crazy deep and I intend to keep it that way!          </p>
