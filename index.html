            <p> Frank Ocean's music speaks to me like <strong><em>no other.</em></strong>
                To me, his music is beautful, soothing and intentful, I can relate to a lot of his lyrics like <strong><em> "Super Rich Kids" lol.."My eyes don't shed tears but boy they pour, when I'm thinkin bout you-" and "Ima try to swim from something bigger than me"</em></strong> 
            He will forever be my favorite artist because it feels as if <strong><em>he wrote the song for me specifically,</em></strong> I'm into his lore like crazy deep and I intend to keep it that way!          </p>

                <p>(I promise my music taste isn't performative)
                    I love Tyler The Creator, <strong><em>personality wise and musically.</em></strong> His music inspires many teenagers and young adults like myself and once I started listening I havent stopped. He's insanely talented, and effecient, which showcases how much he truly appriciates his fans. I mean while on tour for Chromokopia, the guy makes a whole nother album! <strong><em>He loves us!</em></strong>

            <p>Faye Webster's music makes me feel like I'm in Heaven! Her voice is so smooth and light and her music is so symbolically relatable, I feel as if she might be stealing her lyrics from my life..
                I yearn for her soft cool girl aesthetic, and her talent, I once saw her in a Steward Leonards and me and my friend glazed her for like an hour! I was so starstruck omg. <strong><em>I love you Faye Webster.</em></strong>

                <strong><em>I LOVE SOMBR</em></strong> Sombr's music is sooo good, I love his voice and the way he's able to make his music have sad undertones yet still be listenable. Honestly if you told me all of his songs were about the disconnect regarding his ex I would not be an advid listener! Also he's super cute and went to Lag! It can't get any better.

                <p>
                   
                 Solange's music is so aesthetically pleasing! Once I found out Beyonce had a artist sister I was so eager to learn about this person, I was young, me and my dad were in his car and I asked him about "Beyonce's Sister" and he played some Solange for me, specifically <strong><em>"Cranes In The Sky"</em></strong> and that was the best gift he could've given me other than life.               
                </p>
